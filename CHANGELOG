Version 1.5
January 15th, 2012:
	- Added new functions
		trimFromBeginning(inputCurves, shortestLength)
			Cuts the inputCurves from the beginning, with shortestLength dictating the percentage from 
			0.0 to 1.0 of how short the shortest hair is.
		snapBaseToScalp(curves, scalp, mult=[.7, .4, .1])
			Snaps the first CV on the given curves to the given scalp, with the mult value being
			the transition movement of the following 3 CVs
		pushCVOutFromScalp(cvs, scalp, pushMult = 1.5)
			Pushes given CVs away or toward the given scalp using the pushMult value
		pushCurveOutFromScalp(curves, scalp, pushMult = 1.5)
			Pushes given curves away or toward the given scalp using the pushMult value
		averageCV(amount=1.0)
			Similar to average vertex but works on CVs, takes an average of the CVs before and after and
			translates the selected CVs accordingly
		createInterpolatedCurve(curve1, curve2, v)
			Creates an inbetween curve given the 2 curves and a middle value
		createRandomInterpolatedCurves(curves, numCurves)
			Selects random pairs from the given curves and creates random interpolated curves. The
			number of curves that are created is dictated by numCurves,

Version 1.12
September 9th, 2010:
	- Added higher max twist value to 5


Version 1.11
September 7th, 2010:
	- Fixed bug that wouldn't create intermediate hull curves on negative twist values.


Version 1.1
September 6th, 2010:
	- Added ability to twist hair
	- Fixed a bug that errored out if no hairs were created. Now just gives a warning


Version 1.02
August 1st, 2010:
	- Added function to create single curve down the center of the geometry.


Version 1.0
July 14th, 2010:
